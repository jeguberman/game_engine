game_engine is a personal project with the goal of creating a means to build simple platformers in HTML canvas with vanilla javascript and jquery and minimal libraries. The objective is to have something component based, but flexible.

Phase 1: Create an engine capable of supporting a game with
  1: Animations
  2: Physics
  2.5: Inputs
  3: Collision Detection
  4: Menus
  5: An incremental Score
  6: A game over condition

  Basically to recreate my javascript project from my time at App Academy, but with cleaner, clearer code. game.johnguberman.com

Eventually it would be nice to have scrolling and save states and angular collision, but eventually it's like, just use a game engine like phaser, amirite?

### a note on deploying to gitlab

just because my tutorial has a narrator explaining what the steps are, that doesn't mean the narrator needs to actually give the details on the steps, nor is it critically important that the speaker need be more clear than a russian stroke victim sucking on a grapefruit

I'm like almost 100% certain I don't need this step anyway, since every file that matters is hmtl, css or javascript
