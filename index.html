    Whoa! What's this! This is where I'm building a game_engine so I can make the games I want to make. Eventually I will just use a professional game engine, but I wanted to do this for me.

    How did you even get here? You shouldn't know about this? How did you even find this place? You were never supposed to see this. That's why there are todo items on the left side of the view.

    On the right side of the view are links that I find very useful, and referenced while building this thing.
